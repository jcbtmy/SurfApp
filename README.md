Simple Surf App

Built With: React, react-select, leaflet, CanvasJS

This is a web application that utilizes the National Data Buoy Center database to retrieve the current wave height, air temperature, and water temperature for a given bouy off California coast. It allows you to select a station(built with the react-select extension) then retrieve the given spectral and temperature data for the station. The application also features an interactive map, created using the react-leaflet library, to select stations from as well. Once the selection is made the app fetches the data from the server it parses and displays temperature and the wave height for the previous 48 hours using a small graph.
